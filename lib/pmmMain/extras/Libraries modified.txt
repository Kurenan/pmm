1) Radiohead library changed a lot, mostly on RH_RF95.

2) u8g2 library:

  u8x8_d_st7920.c (U8g2_ID942/src/clib)
  FILE CHANGED BY HENRIQUE BRUNO FANTAUZZI DE ALMEIDA: THE HW MODE WASNT WORKING WITH TEENSY 3.6.
  sck_clock_hz was 1000000, underclocking it to 920000 made it work properly.

  static const u8x8_display_info_t u8x8_st7920_128x64_display_info =
  {
    /* sck_clock_hz = */ 920000UL,	/* since Arduino 1.6.0, the SPI bus speed in Hz. Should be  1000000000/sck_pulse_width_ns */
